# ICT-Driven-Agriculture-project
Welcome to the ICT-Driven Agriculture project, part of the Bugema Open Source Community (BOSC). This project empowers smallholder farmers in Uganda and beyond by providing open-source tools for data-driven farming. We focus on collecting soil, weather, and crop data, integrating IoT, supporting farmer decisions with SMS/USSD and mobile dashboards.
